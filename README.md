# Introduction

**Tiny-Scientist** is a lightweight, user-friendly framework for automating the entire lifecycle of scientific research‚Äî**from ideation to implementation, writing, and review**. Designed for flexibility, it integrates smoothly with your favorite LLMs and search tools.

#### Core Features

- üß† **Think**: Generate structured research ideas from an intent string.
- üíª **Code**: Automatically generate and run experiments based on the idea.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Write**: Convert your results and ideas into a conference-style paper.
- üìù **Review**: Review any form of paper and output structured feedback in JSON.

#### Software Architecture

Our codebase is structured around three core components to support an extensible framework: **core**, **tools**, and **formatters**. The **core** module provides essential functionalities, **tools** enhance and extend these core capabilities, and **formatters** handle input/output tasks such as LaTeX template rendering.

# Installation

#### Option 1: Install via pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install tiny-scientist
```

#### Option 2: Install from source

```bash
# create conda environment
conda create -n tiny-scientist python=3.10
conda activate tiny-scientist

# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

# Get started

Before running any code, set your API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
# or use DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Now you can use Tiny-Scientist in Python with only a few lines of code:

```python
from tiny_scientist import TinyScientist

scientist = TinyScientist(model="gpt-4o")

# Step 1: Generate a json-format research idea
idea = scientist.think(intent="Benchmarking adaptive step size strategies using a convex quadratic optimization function")

# Step 2: Run experiments (you can provide baseline_results if available)
status, experiment_dir = scientist.code(idea=idea)

# if the experiments run successfully
if status is True:
    # Step 3: Write a paper
    pdf_path = scientist.write(idea=idea, experiment_dir=experiment_dir)

    # Step 4: Review the paper
    review = scientist.review(pdf_path=pdf_path)
```

# Managing API Keys (Optional)

You can configure keys using a `.toml` file for convenience beyond exporting.

#### Step 1: Copy the template

```bash
cp config.template.toml config.toml
```

#### Step 2: Fill in your API credentials

Edit `config.toml` to include your keys, such as:

```toml
[core]
llm_api_key = "xxxx"
```

No need to export environment variables manually‚Äîjust set this once.

# Q&A

If you face "cairo"-related errors, cario is a system-level dependency, please run `conda install -c conda-forge cairo` or `brew install cairo`.

If you face errors related to pdflatex, this is also a system-level dependency for latex rendering, please run `brew install --cask mactex`.

# Contribution

We‚Äôre working on extending support for more tools, models, and paper formats. Contributions welcome!
