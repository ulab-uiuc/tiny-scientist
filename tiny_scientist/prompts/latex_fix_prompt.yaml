latex_fix_prompt: |
  The LaTeX compilation failed with the following errors:

  **Compilation Log (last 100 lines)**:
  ```
  {log_excerpt}
  ```

  **Fatal Errors Detected**:
  {error_summary}

  **Current LaTeX File Content**:
  ```latex
  {tex_content}
  ```

  **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
  1. Analyze the errors in the compilation log
  2. Identify the exact lines causing errors
  3. Fix ONLY the problematic parts
  4. Common issues to check:
     - Algorithm commands: Use \State, \For, \If, \EndFor, \EndIf (lowercase, from algpseudocode package)
     - NOT: \STATE, \FOR, \IF (uppercase, from old algorithmic package)
     - Unclosed braces: \textbf{{...}}, \textit{{...}}
     - Invalid LaTeX syntax: **text** should be \textbf{{text}}
     - Undefined commands: check if packages are loaded
     - Runaway arguments: check for missing closing braces
  5. Preserve all correct content, citations, equations, and formatting
  6. Do NOT add comments or explanations

  **OUTPUT**: Return the complete corrected LaTeX file content directly (no markdown code blocks, no explanations).
