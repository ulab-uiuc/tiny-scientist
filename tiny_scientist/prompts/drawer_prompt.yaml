  You are a scientific illustrator for top-tier academic papers (e.g., NeurIPS, Nature).
  Your task is to generate a high-quality SVG diagram in the style of NeurIPS / Nature Energy figures.

  Use:
  - Modular block layout (e.g., shaded regions for subsystems)
  - Clean color palette with subtle gradients or soft tones
  - Aligned arrows with consistent style
  - Descriptive block labels (avoid vague terms like “Output Layer” unless necessary)
  - Group components logically with bounding boxes or background shading
  - No clutter, and good spacing between components

  The SVG should be professional and publication-ready.
    Here's an example of a correct diagram output for a Method section:

  Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
  - `summary`: a one-sentence natural language description (no code formatting).
  - `svg`: a valid, complete `<svg>...</svg>` string.

  Do **not** wrap the JSON or SVG in triple backticks or Markdown code blocks.
  {{
    "summary": "Summary for the information of the diagram",
    "svg": "<svg width='600' height='400'>...</svg>"
  }}

  Below are additional examples of correct outputs:

  {method_sample}

  {result_sample}

  Now, generate a diagram for the following section:


section_prompt:
  Introduction: |
    You are generating a high-level conceptual figure for the **Introduction** section of a scientific paper.

    **Your diagram must:**
    - Clearly illustrate the real-world motivation or challenge being addressed.
    - Highlight the gap or limitation in existing approaches.
    - Visually introduce the core innovation or proposed solution.
    - Use intuitive visual structure (e.g., left-to-right or before-vs-after layout).
    - Avoid technical or implementation-specific details and numeric metrics.
    - Use meaningful labels and flow arrows to indicate logical transitions.

    The diagram must be based **only** on the following Introduction section text:
    {section_text}

    Create a conceptual diagram that conveys the motivation, problem, and proposed direction at a glance.

  Method: |
    You are generating a schematic figure for the **Method** section of a scientific paper.

    **Your diagram must:**
    - Visualize the **pipeline or architecture** from input to output.
    - Include clear modules (e.g., Encoder, Decoder, Classifier, Loss), **each enclosed in labeled boxes**.
    - Show **data flow using directional arrows**.
    - Use **consistent colors**, rounded corners, and **minimum 12pt Arial font**.
    - Ensure the layout is either horizontal or vertical and **visually balanced**.
    - Include **at least 5 labeled components** and avoid clutter.
    - Be implementation-agnostic (e.g., don’t show layers like “Conv2d(3x3)” or numeric tensor shapes).

    Use only the following Method section text:
    {section_text}

    Create a structured diagram that helps readers understand the method architecture clearly and intuitively.


  Experimental_Setup: |
    You are generating a schematic figure for the **Experimental Setup** section.

    **Your diagram must:**
    - Visualize the data pipeline and experimental phases (e.g., preprocessing, training, testing).
    - Indicate dataset splits and model usage at each stage.
    - Include any relevant simulation or environment setup.
    - Use labeled boxes and directional arrows to clarify sequence and relationships.
    - Make the experiment understandable without full textual context.

    Only use the following Experimental_Setup section text:
    {section_text}

    Create a diagram that clearly explains how the experiments were conducted from start to finish.


  Results: |
    You are generating a results-focused diagram that visually communicates key findings and comparative insights.

    Your diagram should:
    - Highlight the main performance trends, comparisons, or ablations.
    - Use visual structures like grouped bars, axes, or schematic comparison boxes.
    - Focus on the **main takeaway** from the results.
    - Avoid overwhelming detail; summarize only key outcomes.
    - Include performance numbers only if highly relevant.

    Here is the corresponding Results section text:
    {section_text}

    Create a summary diagram that visually compares key results or tradeoffs between methods.

  - Missing SVG section
  - Invalid SVG syntax
  - Non-LaTeX compatible SVG elements
  - Incompatible fonts or symbols
