diagram_system_prompt_base: |
  You are an expert in creating clear, professional diagrams for academic papers.
  Your task is to generate an SVG diagram that visually represents the key concepts, methods, or workflows described in the text.

  Guidelines:
  1. Create diagrams that are clean, professional, and suitable for academic publication
  2. Use standard diagramming conventions and symbols
  3. Ensure the diagram is self-contained and can be understood without additional context
  4. Include appropriate labels, arrows, and annotations
  5. Make the diagram scalable and maintainable
  6. Focus on clarity and readability over artistic complexity
  7. Ensure the SVG code is compatible with LaTeX figure environment
  8. Use LaTeX-compatible fonts and symbols in labels
  9. Keep the diagram size reasonable for a single-column academic paper

  Your response must include:
  1. A SUMMARY section describing the key elements of the diagram (this will be used as the figure caption)
  2. A DIAGRAM SVG section containing the actual SVG code (this will be embedded in a LaTeX figure)
  3. The SVG must be valid, self-contained, and LaTeX-compatible

template_instructions: |
  Please create a professional academic diagram based on the provided text.
  The diagram should:
  - Clearly illustrate the key concepts and relationships
  - Use appropriate visual elements (boxes, arrows, etc.)
  - Include clear labels and annotations
  - Be scalable and maintainable
  - Follow academic diagramming conventions
  - Be compatible with LaTeX figure environment
  - Use LaTeX-compatible fonts and symbols

  Your response must include:
  1. A SUMMARY section describing the key elements of the diagram (will be used as figure caption)
  2. A DIAGRAM SVG section containing the actual SVG code (will be embedded in LaTeX)

few_shot_instructions: |
  Here is an example of how to create a diagram:
  {example}

  Based on this example, please create a diagram for the following text.

error_list: |
  - Missing or invalid SVG code
  - Unclear or missing labels
  - Inconsistent styling
  - Overly complex or cluttered diagrams
  - Missing key elements from the text
  - Poor scaling or layout
  - Unprofessional appearance
  - Missing summary section
  - Missing SVG section
  - Invalid SVG syntax
  - Non-LaTeX compatible SVG elements
  - Incompatible fonts or symbols
  - Oversized diagrams
  - Poor figure caption content

refinement_prompt: |
  Please review and refine the diagram you just created.
  Focus on:
  - Adding modular structure (e.g., labeled stages for "Input", "Processing", "Output")
  - Including visual indicators for dynamic processes (e.g., dashed arrows for adaptive flows)
  - Better layout alignment (use horizontal or vertical symmetry)
  - Distinguishing components visually (via grouping boxes or layout space)
  - Fixing SVG issues: alignment, font size, spacing, and arrow direction

  Your output must include both a SUMMARY and a valid SVG diagram.
  Pay particular attention to fixing any errors such as:
  {error_list}

  Here is the current diagram:
  """
  {diagram_content}
  """

  Please provide an improved version that addresses any issues while maintaining the core message and structure.
  Ensure the diagram is properly formatted for LaTeX integration.
