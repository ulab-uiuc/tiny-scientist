planner_system_prompt: >
  You are an expert experimental design specialist who creates comprehensive research plans.
  Your role is to develop detailed, actionable experimental plans that directly support the investigation of research ideas.
  Be thorough, practical, and ensure your plans are feasible with available resources.

experiment_plan_prompt: |
  Given the following research idea:

  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  And the ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  Develop a comprehensive experimental plan. You must provide TWO separate outputs: a JSON object and a Markdown table.

  IMPORTANT: Your experiment plan MUST directly support investigation of the original intent. Ensure that your experimental design directly addresses the research question posed in the original intent and builds upon the idea that was generated. Your response should heavily rely on literature search; use the approaches from relevant papers as references.

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  EXPERIMENT PLAN JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```
  EXPERIMENT PLAN MARKDOWN TABLE:
  ```markdown
  <MARKDOWN_TABLE>
  ```
  In <THOUGHT>, briefly discuss your reasoning behind the chosen approach.

  In <JSON>, provide the plan in JSON format with these fields:
  - "Model": Description of model architecture
  - "Dataset": Description of dataset
  - "Metric": Description of evaluation metric

  In <MARKDOWN_TABLE>, provide a more detailed plan as a Markdown table. This table MUST include the following columns:
  - "Component": The part of the experiment (e.g., Model, Dataset, Baselines, Evaluation Metric).
  - "Specification": A detailed description of the chosen approach.
  - "Justification / Rationale": Why this choice is appropriate, citing relevant literature.
  - "Status": Leave this column EMPTY.

non_experiment_plan_prompt: |
  Given the following non-experimental research idea:

  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  And the ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  Develop a comprehensive research plan. You must provide TWO separate outputs: a JSON object and a Markdown table.

  IMPORTANT: Your research plan MUST directly support the investigation of the original intent.

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  EXPERIMENT PLAN JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```
  EXPERIMENT PLAN MARKDOWN TABLE:
  ```markdown
  <MARKDOWN_TABLE>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, briefly discuss your reasoning behind the chosen approach.

  In <JSON>, provide a concise research plan in JSON format with a SINGLE field:
  - "Research_Plan": A detailed paragraph describing the complete research plan.

  In <MARKDOWN_TABLE>, provide a more detailed plan as a Markdown table. This table MUST include the following columns:
  - "Phase": The stage of the research (e.g., Literature Review, Data Collection, Analysis).
  - "Methodology": The specific methods to be used in this phase.
  - "Expected Outcome": The deliverable or result of this phase.
  - "Status": Leave this column EMPTY.
