section_tips:
  Abstract: |
    - TL;DR of the paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)

    Please make sure the abstract reads smoothly and is well-motivated. This should be one continuous paragraph with no breaks between the lines.

  Introduction: |
    - Think of the introduction as a comprehensive preview of the entire paper.
    - Open with context: why now, why this field, and what’s at stake.
    - Define the exact problem and why it’s still unsolved despite prior efforts.
    - Clarify your insight or hypothesis that led to the proposed approach.
    - Explicitly state what’s new and how your work differs from previous methods.
    - Outline the methodology and evaluation approach at a high level.
    - List contributions in bullets (aim for specificity, not generic points).
    - Include a roadmap that previews each major section of the paper.
    - The introduction should be self-contained and understandable without reading the full paper.

  Related_Work: |
    - Focus on academic siblings of our work — i.e., alternative approaches in the literature attempting to solve the same or similar problem.
    - The goal is to "compare and contrast": how do these methods differ in assumptions, objectives, or techniques?
    - Simply describing a paper is not enough — explain how it relates to our study and why it matters.
    - If a cited method is applicable to our problem setting, note its strengths or weaknesses. If it is not applicable, clearly justify why.
    - Organize the discussion into coherent subtopics or themes.
    - Use only the provided paper list, and cite each using \cite{{...}} placeholders.

  Method: |
    - Clearly describe what your method does and how it works.
    - Start with intuition before diving into formal equations or code details.
    - Use the same naming as in your figures/code to ensure consistency.
    - Formalize the key parts: models, loss functions, algorithms, and modules.
    - Emphasize what’s **new** and how it extends prior work.
    - Be as explicit as possible about algorithmic flow, data dependencies, and expected behavior.
    - Assume readers will try to re-implement your method — make that feasible.

  Experimental_Setup: |
    - How do we test that our stuff works? Introduces a specific instantiation of the Problem Setting and specific implementation details of our Method for this Problem Setting.
    - Do not imagine unknown hardware details.
    - Includes a description of the dataset, evaluation metrics, important hyperparameters, and implementation details.

  Results: |
    - Shows the results of running Method on our problem described in Experimental Setup.
    - Includes statements on hyperparameters and other potential issues of fairness.
    - Only includes results that have actually been run and saved in the logs. Do not hallucinate results that don't exist.
    - If results exist: compares to baselines and includes statistics and confidence intervals.
    - If results exist: includes ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
    - Discusses limitations of the method.
    - Make sure to include all the results from the experiments, and include all relevant figures.

  Discussion: |
    - Analyze what the experimental results reveal in the context of the original research question.
    - Reflect on whether your method outperformed the baseline — and why that might be the case.
    - Discuss any cases where your method underperformed or behaved unexpectedly.
    - Identify the strengths and weaknesses of your approach based on the comparison to the baseline.
    - Connect these insights to the broader literature or practical use cases (without repeating the Related Work section).
    - Acknowledge limitations in the findings and suggest possible improvements.
    - Offer realistic ideas for future work or applications of your method.


  Conclusion: |
    - Brief recap of the entire paper.
    - To keep going with the analogy, you can think of future work as (potential) academic offspring.
