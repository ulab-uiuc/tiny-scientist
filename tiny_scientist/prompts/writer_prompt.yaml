write_system_prompt:
  You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.
  You have already figured out the research idea and the experiments you want to run.
  Now, you need to write the paper draft based on the template provided in `latex/template.tex`.

  ⚠️ Do not include any citations or \cite{{}} commands in the content.
  Just focus on writing clear and coherent content that explains the motivation, methodology, experiments, and results.
  When including tables, always use proper LaTeX tabular format (not Markdown).
  Avoid using Markdown-style tables (e.g., those starting with `| Column |`) — they are not compatible with LaTeX rendering and will break the document.

  The purpose of this draft is to flesh out the content. Citations will be added later during the refinement process.
  Your goal is to make the paper look and feel like a real submission to NeurIPS or Nature. All figures, tables, and text must be cleanly formatted and publication-ready.

  Here's an example of a well-written paper draft to guide your writing style, tone, and section lengths

  Abstract: |
    - TL;DR of the paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)

    Please make sure the abstract reads smoothly and is well-motivated. This should be one continuous paragraph with no breaks between the lines.

  Introduction: |
    - Longer version of the Abstract, i.e. of the entire paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
    - New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points
    - Extra space? Future work!

  Related_Work: |
    - Academic siblings of our work, i.e. alternative attempts in literature at trying to solve the same problem.
    - Goal is to “Compare and contrast” - how does their approach differ in either assumptions or method? If their method is applicable to our Problem Setting I expect a comparison in the experimental section. If not, there needs to be a clear statement why a given method is not applicable.
    - Note: Just describing what another paper is doing is not enough. We need to compare and contrast.

  Method: |
    - What we do. Why we do it. All described using the general Formalism introduced in the Problem Setting and building on top of the concepts / foundations introduced in Background.

  Experimental_Setup: |
    - How do we test that our stuff works? Introduces a specific instantiation of the Problem Setting and specific implementation details of our Method for this Problem Setting.
    - Do not imagine unknown hardware details.
    - Includes a description of the dataset, evaluation metrics, important hyperparameters, and implementation details.

  Results: |
    - Shows the results of running Method on our problem described in Experimental Setup.
    - Includes statements on hyperparameters and other potential issues of fairness.
    - Only includes results that have actually been run and saved in the logs. Do not hallucinate results that don't exist.
    - If results exist: compares to baselines and includes statistics and confidence intervals.
    - If results exist: includes ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
    - Discusses limitations of the method.
    - Make sure to include all the results from the experiments, and include all relevant figures.

  Discussion: |
    - Analyze what the experimental results reveal in the context of the original research question.
    - Reflect on whether your method outperformed the baseline — and why that might be the case.
    - Discuss any cases where your method underperformed or behaved unexpectedly.
    - Identify the strengths and weaknesses of your approach based on the comparison to the baseline.
    - Connect these insights to the broader literature or practical use cases (without repeating the Related Work section).
    - Acknowledge limitations in the findings and suggest possible improvements.
    - Offer realistic ideas for future work or applications of your method.

  Conclusion: |
    - Brief recap of the entire paper.
    - To keep going with the analogy, you can think of future work as (potential) academic offspring.

error_list: |
  - Unenclosed math symbols
  - Only reference figures that exist in our directory
  - LaTeX syntax errors
  - Numerical results that do not come from explicit experiments and logs
  - Repeatedly defined figure labels
  - Unnecessary verbosity or repetition, unclear text
  - Results or insights in the notes.txt that have not yet been included
  - Any relevant figures that have not yet been included in the text
  - Improper closing of environments (e.g., use \end{figure} for \begin{figure})
  - Duplicate headers (e.g., multiple \section{Introduction})
  - Unescaped special characters (e.g., use shakespeare\_char instead of shakespeare_char)
  - Incorrect closing of environments (e.g., </end{figure}> instead of \end{figure})

title_refinement_prompt: |
  Great job! Now that there is a complete draft of the entire paper, let's refine each section again.
  Here is the current paper draft:
  {full_draft}

  Please provide a single, concise title that clearly reflects the paper's concept.

  {bibtex}
  """
  You do not need to add them yourself.
  ABSOLUTELY DO NOT ADD IT AGAIN!!!

  Make the proposed change to the draft incorporating these new cites:
  {description}

  Use your judgment for whether these should be cited anywhere else.
  Make sure that any citation precisely matches the name in `references.bib`. Change its name to the correct name in the bibtex if needed.
  Ensure the citation is well-integrated into the text.
  You must use \cite or \citet to reference papers, do not manually type out author names.
