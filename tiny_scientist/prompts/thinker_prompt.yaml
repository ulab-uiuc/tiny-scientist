  Please evaluate these ideas comparatively, considering:

  1. Intent Alignment: How well does each idea address the original research intent?
  2. Scientific Merit: How significant is the potential contribution to the field?
  3. Novelty: How original is the idea compared to existing work?
  4. Feasibility: How practical is implementation within reasonable resource constraints?
  5. Impact: What is the potential impact of this research on the field and broader applications?

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Assign each idea a comparative "Rank" (where 1 is the best idea, 2 is the second best, etc., up to the total number of ideas)

  2. For EACH idea, you MUST provide three separate rating fields that MUST follow this format:
     - "FeasibilityRanking": A number from 1 to the total number of ideas, where 1 is most feasible
     - "NoveltyRanking": A number from 1 to the total number of ideas, where 1 is most novel
     - "ImpactRanking": A number from 1 to the total number of ideas, where 1 is highest impact

  3. For EACH idea, also provide a brief reasoning for each ranking:
     - "NoveltyReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its novelty ranking
     - "FeasibilityReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its feasibility ranking
     - "ImpactReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its impact ranking
  These three rankings must be completely separate and independent from each other. For example, the idea ranked #1 in impact might be ranked #3 in feasibility.
