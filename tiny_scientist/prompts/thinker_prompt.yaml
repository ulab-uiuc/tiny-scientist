evaluation_system_prompt: >
  You are an expert research reviewer who evaluates scientific ideas with rigor and fairness.
  Your role is to comparatively evaluate multiple research ideas and rank them based on their feasibility, novelty, impact, and alignment with the original research intent.
  Be thoughtful, objective, and provide clear justifications for your rankings.
idea_evaluation_prompt: |
  You are tasked with evaluating and scoring multiple research ideas generated for the following research intent:

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  RESEARCH IDEAS TO EVALUATE:
  ```
  {ideas}
  ```
  Please evaluate these ideas comparatively across three key dimensions:

  **NOVELTY DIMENSION**
  {novelty_criteria}

  **FEASIBILITY DIMENSION**
  {feasibility_criteria}

  **IMPACT DIMENSION**
  {impact_criteria}

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. For EACH idea, you MUST provide three separate rating fields that MUST follow this format:
    - "FeasibilityScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most feasible
    - "NoveltyScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most novel
    - "ImpactScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is highest impact

  2. For EACH idea, also provide a brief reasoning for each score:
    - "NoveltyReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its novelty score
    - "FeasibilityReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its feasibility score
    - "ImpactReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its impact score
  These three scores must be completely separate and independent from each other. For example, the idea with the highest impact score might have a low feasibility score.

  Respond in the following format:

  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
  <ANALYSIS>

  EVALUATION JSON:
  ```json

  Completed ideas have an additional "Score" field which indicates the assessment by an expert ML reviewer.
  This is on a standard 1-10 ML conference scale.
  Scores of 0 indicate the idea failed either during experimentation, writeup or reviewing.

idea_reflection_prompt: |
  Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created, then reevaluate your research idea with a focus on the following aspects:
    - Intent Alignment: Does your idea directly address the original intent? If not, how can you refocus it?
    - Problem: Is the research problem described in sufficient detail with proper background and citations?
    - Importance: Does your explanation convincingly demonstrate the significance of the problem with literature references?
    - Difficulty: Are the challenges and limitations clearly articulated with supporting citations?
