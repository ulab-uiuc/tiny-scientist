  Be critical and realistic in your assessments.
evaluation_system_prompt: >
  You are an expert research reviewer who evaluates scientific ideas with rigor and fairness.
  Your role is to comparatively evaluate multiple research ideas and score them based on their feasibility, novelty, impact, and alignment with the original research intent.
  Be thoughtful, objective, and provide clear justifications for your scoring.
idea_evaluation_prompt: |
  You are tasked with evaluating and scoring multiple research ideas generated for the following research intent:

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  RESEARCH IDEAS TO EVALUATE:
  ```
  {ideas}
  ```
  Please evaluate these ideas comparatively across three key dimensions:

  **NOVELTY DIMENSION**
  {novelty_criteria}

  **FEASIBILITY DIMENSION**
  {feasibility_criteria}

  **IMPACT DIMENSION**
  {impact_criteria}

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. For EACH idea, you MUST provide three separate rating fields that MUST follow this format:
    - "FeasibilityScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most feasible
    - "NoveltyScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most novel
    - "ImpactScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is highest impact

  2. For EACH idea, also provide a brief reasoning for each score:
    - "NoveltyReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its novelty score
    - "FeasibilityReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its feasibility score
    - "ImpactReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its impact score
  These three scores must be completely separate and independent from each other. For example, the idea with the highest impact score might have a low feasibility score.

  Respond in the following format:

  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
  <ANALYSIS>

  EVALUATION JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <ANALYSIS>, provide a thoughtful comparative analysis discussing the trade-offs between ideas.
  In <JSON>, provide the evaluation results in JSON format with the following structure:
  "scored_ideas": A list of scored idea objects, each containing:
  - "Title": The EXACT original title of the idea as provided in the input JSON - DO NOT MODIFY OR CHANGE THE TITLE IN ANY WAY
  - "FeasibilityScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring feasibility
  - "NoveltyScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring novelty
  - "ImpactScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring impact
  - "NoveltyReason": Explanation of the novelty score
  - "FeasibilityReason": Explanation of the feasibility score
  - "ImpactReason": Explanation of the impact score

  CRITICAL: You MUST preserve the exact original titles from the input. Do not change, modify, or improve the titles in any way.
  Ensure your evaluation is fair, comprehensive, and based solely on the scientific and practical merits of each idea.
modify_idea_prompt: |
  Given a research idea and a set of requested modifications, generate a modified version of the idea.

  ORIGINAL RESEARCH IDEA:
  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS:
  ```
  {modifications}
  ```

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```
  Carefully consider how to preserve the core strengths of the original idea while enhancing it according to the requested modifications. Ensure the modified idea maintains strong alignment with the original research intent.

  For each modification request, adjust the corresponding aspect (Novelty, Feasibility, or Impact) by emphasizing or de-emphasizing relevant characteristics.

  **CRITICAL**: When modifying the idea:
  - Keep the "Approach" field focused on the CORE NOVEL ALGORITHM (not basic preprocessing)
  - The "Approach" should describe YOUR algorithmic innovation with mathematical/technical detail
  - If increasing Novelty, add more distinctive technical innovations to the CORE ALGORITHM
  - If increasing Feasibility, provide implementation details for the NOVEL component specifically
  - Maintain detailed comparison with existing work in "NoveltyComparison"
  - AVOID filling "Approach" with standard data processing, tokenization, or routine training procedures
  - AVOID ethical considerations, societal impact, or bias discussions in "Approach" - focus ONLY on the technical algorithm

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  MODIFIED IDEA JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, explain your reasoning for the modifications and how they enhance the idea.
  In <JSON>, provide the modified idea with the same structure as the original, including all original fields.

merge_ideas_prompt: |
  You are tasked with merging two research ideas into a single, stronger idea that combines the best aspects of both.

  IDEA A:

novelty_system_prompt: |
  You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.
  You have an idea and you want to check if it is novel or not. I.e., not overlapping significantly with existing literature or already well explored.
  Be a harsh critic for novelty, ensure there is a sufficient contribution in the idea for a new conference or workshop paper.
  You are analyzing search results to determine if your idea has already been explored in existing literature.

  Decide a paper idea is novel if after sufficient searching, you have not found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.
  Decide a paper idea is not novel if you have found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.

query_prompt: |
  Based on the following research intent:

  ```
  {intent}
  ```
  Please generate a simple and effective search query to find the most relevant related work in the scientific literature.

  **CRITICAL**: Focus your query on the UNIQUE/NOVEL aspects of the research approach, not just general topics.
  
  **SEARCH STRATEGY**:
  1. Identify the CORE INNOVATION or unique combination in the intent
  2. Search for papers specifically related to this novelty
  3. Example: If using "causal graphs for GNN", search for "causal graph" AND "graph neural networks", NOT just "GNN"
  4. Example: If proposing "adaptive attention for low-resource translation", search for "adaptive attention" AND "low-resource translation"

  **QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES**:
  1. Use AND to connect the NOVEL component with the application domain
  2. Use OR sparingly for alternative terms of the SAME concept
  3. Keep multi-word phrases as simple text (e.g., causal graph, not "causal graph")
  4. Keep it simple: 3-5 main concepts, avoid nested parentheses
  5. Focus on what makes the idea UNIQUE, not general background

  **GOOD EXAMPLES** (focused on novelty):
  - causal graph AND graph neural networks
  - adaptive attention AND (low-resource OR few-shot) AND translation
  - contrastive learning AND graph structure
  - meta-learning AND few-shot classification
  
  **BAD EXAMPLES** (too general or complex):
  - "graph neural networks" (too general, misses the unique part)
  - "machine translation" (too broad, no novel component)
  - ((A OR B) AND (C OR D)) OR ((E AND F) OR G) (too complex)

  Respond in the following format:

  RESPONSE:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
  - "Query": The query you just generated (3-5 concepts, use AND/OR strategically)

  **CRITICAL**: Focus your query on the NOVEL/UNIQUE component of the current idea, not just general topics.
  
  **SEARCH STRATEGY**:
  1. Extract the CORE INNOVATION from the current idea (e.g., the specific algorithm, mechanism, or unique combination)
  2. Search for papers specifically addressing this novel aspect
  3. Example: If idea uses "hierarchical attention with dynamic weighting", search for "hierarchical attention" AND "dynamic weighting"

  **QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES**:
  1. Use AND to connect the NOVEL MECHANISM with the problem domain
  2. Identify and search for the specific technical contribution, not general background
  3. Keep multi-word phrases as simple text (e.g., causal intervention, not "causal intervention")
  4. Keep it simple: 3-5 main concepts, avoid nested parentheses
  5. Focus on what makes this idea UNIQUE compared to standard approaches

  **GOOD EXAMPLES** (focused on the unique component):
  - hierarchical attention AND dynamic weighting AND classification
  - causal intervention AND bias mitigation AND NLP
  - contrastive learning AND graph structure AND representation
  
  **BAD EXAMPLES** (too general or misses novelty):

  Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  CURRENT IDEA TO REFLECT ON:
  ```
  {current_idea}
  ```

  **YOUR GOAL**: Transform this idea into a **CONCRETE, DETAILED, NOVEL, and TECHNICALLY SOLID** research proposal that could be immediately implemented and published.

  In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea above, then reevaluate your research idea with a focus on the following aspects:
  
    - **Intent Alignment**: Does your idea directly address the original intent? If not, how can you refocus it?
    
    - **Problem**: Is the research problem described in sufficient detail with proper background and citations?
      * Provide specific examples and concrete scenarios
      * Include quantitative statements where possible
    
    - **Importance**: Does your explanation convincingly demonstrate the significance of the problem with literature references?
      * Add concrete evidence of the problem's impact
      * Cite recent work showing the urgency
    
    - **Difficulty**: Are the challenges and limitations clearly articulated with supporting citations?
      * Explain WHY naive approaches fail with specific technical reasons
      * Provide concrete failure cases or bottlenecks
    
    - **NoveltyComparison**: **CRITICAL** - Have you clearly differentiated your idea from existing work?
      * Compare with at least 3-5 specific recent papers
      * For EACH paper, explicitly state: (1) What they do, (2) Their limitation, (3) How your approach differs
      * Identify the UNIQUE technical contribution that makes your work publishable
      * Be specific about what combination of techniques/insights is novel
      * If the novelty is incremental, make it clear what specific advancement you're making
    
    - **Approach**: **MOST CRITICAL** - Does it focus on the CORE NOVEL ALGORITHM/MECHANISM?
      * **Focus Check**: Does 80%+ of the description focus on YOUR algorithmic innovation, not basic preprocessing?
      * **Algorithm Detail**: Is the core algorithm described with mathematical formulation or algorithmic steps?
      * **Design Rationale**: Is it clear WHY this algorithm is designed this way?
      * **Technical Depth**: Are the key computations, inputs/outputs, and equations specified?
      * **Differentiation**: Is it clear HOW your algorithm differs from existing ones at the technical level?
      * **Implementation-ready**: Can someone implement YOUR NOVEL ALGORITHM from this description?
      * **NO FLUFF**: Remove or minimize descriptions of standard tokenization, data loading, basic training loops
      * **NO ETHICS**: Remove any discussion of ethical considerations, societal impact, or bias - these are NOT part of the core algorithm
      * **Example Good**: "Our core contribution is a Dynamic Attention Pooling mechanism: Given input tokens X ∈ R^(n×d), we compute attention weights α_i = softmax(W_q X_i^T · W_k X / √d) where W_q and W_k are learnable projection matrices..."
      * **Example Bad**: "We first tokenize the input using standard tokenization, then feed it into a transformer model with several layers, train it with Adam optimizer..."
      * **Example Bad**: "We also consider ethical implications and ensure fairness..." (Save this for a separate ethics section, NOT in Approach)
      * If the approach describes standard procedures or ethical considerations instead of the novel algorithm, you MUST rewrite it

  Refer to the following related works from recent literature that might help inform your reflection:

  ```
  {related_works_string}
  ```
  **REFINEMENT PRIORITIES** (in order of importance):
  1. **Core Algorithm Focus**: Ensure "Approach" focuses 80%+ on YOUR novel algorithm, not standard procedures
  2. **Mathematical/Algorithmic Depth**: Add formulations, algorithm steps, and implementation details of the NOVEL component
  3. **Novelty Clarity**: Explicitly state what's algorithmically new compared to 3-5 specific existing works
  4. **Design Rationale**: Justify WHY your algorithm is designed this way
  5. **Remove Fluff**: Eliminate lengthy descriptions of standard preprocessing, tokenization, basic training
  6. **Remove Ethics**: Eliminate any discussion of ethical considerations, societal impact, or bias from "Approach"

  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REFINED IDEA**:
  - Approach section: MUST focus on CORE NOVEL ALGORITHM (200-300 words)
  - 80%+ of "Approach" describes YOUR algorithmic innovation, not basic procedures
  - Include mathematical formulation OR algorithmic steps of your novel component
  - NoveltyComparison: MUST compare against at least 3-5 specific papers by name
  - Every algorithmic design choice MUST have a technical justification
  - Minimize descriptions of standard tokenization, data loading, routine training
  - NO ethical considerations, societal impact, or bias discussions in "Approach"

  IMPORTANT: Your refined idea MUST maintain strong alignment with the original intent. If the current idea has drifted away from the original intent, you must realign it.

  Do not make things overly complicated, but DO make them technically precise and detailed.
  In the next attempt, significantly improve the technical depth, novelty clarity, and implementation details.
  If the current idea is vague or lacks technical substance, this is a MAJOR issue that must be fixed.

  4. Consider if the idea offers meaningful innovation beyond existing approaches
  5. Assess whether minor variations from existing work constitute sufficient novelty

  In <DECISION>, write either:
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: CONTINUE" if you need more information to make a decision. In this case, explain what specific information you need.
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: NOVEL" if you've determined the idea is novel. Briefly explain why.
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: NOT NOVEL" if you've determined the idea is not novel. Briefly explain why and cite the specific paper(s) that demonstrate lack of novelty.

experiment_plan_prompt: |
  Given the following research idea:

  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  And the ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  Develop a comprehensive experimental plan. You must provide TWO separate outputs: a JSON object and a Markdown table.

  IMPORTANT: Your experiment plan MUST directly support investigation of the original intent. Ensure that your experimental design directly addresses the research question posed in the original intent and builds upon the idea that was generated. Your response should heavily rely on literature search; use the approaches from relevant papers as references.

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  EXPERIMENT PLAN JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```
  EXPERIMENT PLAN MARKDOWN TABLE:
  ```markdown
  <MARKDOWN_TABLE>
  ```
  In <THOUGHT>, briefly discuss your reasoning behind the chosen approach.

  In <JSON>, provide the plan in JSON format with these fields:
  - "Model": Detailed description of model architecture with specific components
  - "Dataset": Detailed description of dataset including size, split, preprocessing
  - "Metric": Description of evaluation metrics with justification

  In <MARKDOWN_TABLE>, provide a DETAILED experimental plan as a Markdown table. This table MUST include the following columns and rows:
  - "Component": The part of the experiment
  - "Specification": A DETAILED description with specifics (not vague descriptions)
  - "Justification / Rationale": Why this choice is appropriate, citing relevant literature
  - "Status": Leave this column EMPTY
  
  **REQUIRED ROWS** (at minimum):
  1. **Model Architecture**: Specify exact architecture, layers, dimensions, parameters
  2. **Dataset**: Name, size, splits (train/val/test), preprocessing steps
  3. **Baselines**: List 3-5 specific baseline methods to compare against (with citations)
  4. **Training Setup**: Optimizer, learning rate, batch size, epochs, hardware
  5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Primary and secondary metrics with justification
  6. **Hyperparameters**: Key hyperparameters and their values/ranges
  
  Each specification should be concrete and implementation-ready, not high-level or vague.

  Given the following non-experimental research idea:

  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  And the ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  Develop a comprehensive research plan. You must provide TWO separate outputs: a JSON object and a Markdown table.

  IMPORTANT: Your research plan MUST directly support the investigation of the original intent.

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  EXPERIMENT PLAN JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```
  EXPERIMENT PLAN MARKDOWN TABLE:
  ```markdown
  <MARKDOWN_TABLE>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, briefly discuss your reasoning behind the chosen approach.

  In <JSON>, provide a concise research plan in JSON format with a SINGLE field:
  - "Research_Plan": A detailed paragraph describing the complete research plan.

  In <MARKDOWN_TABLE>, provide a more detailed plan as a Markdown table. This table MUST include the following columns:
  - "Phase": The stage of the research (e.g., Literature Review, Data Collection, Analysis).
  - "Methodology": The specific methods to be used in this phase.
  - "Expected Outcome": The deliverable or result of this phase.
  - "Status": Leave this column EMPTY.
