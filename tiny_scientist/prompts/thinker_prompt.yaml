  Additionally, based on recent literature, here are some related works that might inform your next idea:

  ```
  {related_works_string}
  ```

  Based on the above, come up with the next impactful and creative research idea that addresses the following questions:
  1. What is the problem?
    - Provide a comprehensive description of the research problem, including background, current challenges, and why the issue persists.
    - Include citations where relevant. All citations should be in parentheses (e.g., (Workowski & Bolan, 2015)).
    - Make sure this problem statement directly addresses the original intent.
  2. Why is it interesting and important?
    - Explain in detail why the problem is interesting and important. Support your claims with references from recent literature.
    - Connect the importance back to the original intent.
  3. Why is it hard?
    - Analyze the inherent challenges of the problem and explain why naive approaches have failed, citing previous studies.
    - Discuss why this problem remains difficult in the context of the original intent.
  4. Why hasn't it been solved before?
    - Clearly describe how your idea differs from existing solutions. Highlight innovative aspects and include comparative citations.
    - Explain why existing approaches from the related works don't fully address the intent.
  5. What are the key components of my approach and results?
    - Outline your proposed methodology.
    - Explain how your approach specifically addresses the original intent.

  Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets.
  Make sure any idea is not overfit to the specific training dataset or model, and has wider significance.
  Your idea MUST directly address the intent specified above.

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  NEW IDEA JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

  In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:
  - "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
  - "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.
  - "Problem": Answer to question 1.
  - "Importance": Answer to question 2.
  - "Difficulty": Answer to question 3.
  - "NoveltyComparison": Answer to question 4.
  - "Approach": Answer to question 5.
  - "Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "IntentAlignment": A rating from 1 to 10 indicating how well the idea addresses the original intent.
  - "Score": Your assessment of this idea on the standard 1-10 ML conference scale.

  Be cautious and realistic on your ratings.
  This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
  You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.

  Completed ideas have an additional "Score" field which indicates the assessment by an expert ML reviewer.
  This is on a standard 1-10 ML conference scale.
  Scores of 0 indicate the idea failed either during experimentation, writeup or reviewing.

idea_reflection_prompt: |
  Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  '''
  {intent}
  '''

  In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created, then reevaluate your research idea with a focus on the following aspects:
    - Intent Alignment: Does your idea directly address the original intent? If not, how can you refocus it?
    - Problem: Is the research problem described in sufficient detail with proper background and citations?
    - Importance: Does your explanation convincingly demonstrate the significance of the problem with literature references?
    - Difficulty: Are the challenges and limitations clearly articulated with supporting citations?
    - NoveltyComparison: Have you clearly differentiated your idea from existing work, with appropriate references?
    - Approach: Is your proposed methodology described in detail and well-justified with citations?

  Refer to the following related works from recent literature that might help inform your reflection:

  ```
  {related_works_string}
  ```
  IMPORTANT: Your refined idea MUST maintain strong alignment with the original intent. If the current idea has drifted away from the original intent, you must realign it.

  Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the idea.
  Ensure the idea is clear and concise, and the JSON is the correct format.
  Do not make things overly complicated.
  In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your idea.
  Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are glaring issues.

  Respond in the same format as before:
  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  REFLECTED IDEA JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```
  In <JSON>, provide the reflected idea in JSON format with the following fields:
  - "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
  - "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.
  - "Problem": Answer to question 1.
  - "Importance": Answer to question 2.
  - "Difficulty": Answer to question 3.
  - "NoveltyComparison": Answer to question 4.
  - "Approach": Answer to question 5.
  - "Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
  - "IntentAlignment": A rating from 1 to 10 indicating how well the idea addresses the original intent.
  - "Score": Your assessment of this idea on the standard 1-10 ML conference scale.

  If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous JSON EXACTLY after the thought and include "I am done" at the end of the thoughts but before the JSON.
  ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES.

novelty_prompt: |
  Round {current_round}/{num_rounds}.
  You are assessing the novelty of the following research idea in the context of the original intent:

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  '''
  {intent}
  '''

  CURRENT IDEA:
  """
  {idea}
  """

  SEARCH RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS QUERY:
  """
  {last_query_results}
  """

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  DECISION:
  <DECISION>

  In <THOUGHT>, carefully analyze the idea's novelty by:
  1. First explicitly assess how well the idea aligns with the original intent
  2. Compare the idea against the search results to identify similarities and differences
  3. Determine if any existing work already implements the core approach for the same intent
  4. Consider if the idea offers meaningful innovation beyond existing approaches
  5. Assess whether minor variations from existing work constitute sufficient novelty

  In <DECISION>, write either:
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: CONTINUE" if you need more information to make a decision. In this case, explain what specific information you need.
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: NOVEL" if you've determined the idea is novel. Briefly explain why.
  - "NOVELTY CHECK: NOT NOVEL" if you've determined the idea is not novel. Briefly explain why and cite the specific paper(s) that demonstrate lack of novelty.
