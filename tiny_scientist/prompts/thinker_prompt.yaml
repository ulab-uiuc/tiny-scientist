# System prompts
idea_system_prompt: >
  You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.
  You want to generate creative and impactful research ideas that can be feasibly investigated with the code provided.
  Be critical and realistic in your assessments.
evaluation_system_prompt: >
  You are an expert research reviewer who evaluates scientific ideas with rigor and fairness.
  Your role is to comparatively evaluate multiple research ideas and score them based on their feasibility, novelty, impact, and alignment with the original research intent.
  Be thoughtful, objective, and provide clear justifications for your scoring.
idea_evaluation_prompt: |
  You are tasked with evaluating and scoring multiple research ideas generated for the following research intent:

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  RESEARCH IDEAS TO EVALUATE:
  ```
  {ideas}
  ```
  Please evaluate these ideas comparatively across three key dimensions:

  **NOVELTY DIMENSION**
  {novelty_criteria}

  **FEASIBILITY DIMENSION**
  {feasibility_criteria}

  **IMPACT DIMENSION**
  {impact_criteria}

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. For EACH idea, you MUST provide three separate rating fields that MUST follow this format:
    - "FeasibilityScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most feasible
    - "NoveltyScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is most novel
    - "ImpactScore": A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is highest impact

  2. For EACH idea, also provide a brief reasoning for each score:
    - "NoveltyReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its novelty score
    - "FeasibilityReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its feasibility score
    - "ImpactReason": Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this idea received its impact score
  These three scores must be completely separate and independent from each other. For example, the idea with the highest impact score might have a low feasibility score.

  Respond in the following format:

  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
  <ANALYSIS>

  EVALUATION JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <ANALYSIS>, provide a thoughtful comparative analysis discussing the trade-offs between ideas.
  In <JSON>, provide the evaluation results in JSON format with the following structure:
  "scored_ideas": A list of scored idea objects, each containing:
  - "Title": The EXACT original title of the idea as provided in the input JSON - DO NOT MODIFY OR CHANGE THE TITLE IN ANY WAY
  - "FeasibilityScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring feasibility
  - "NoveltyScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring novelty
  - "ImpactScore": A number from 0 to 100, scoring impact
  - "NoveltyReason": Explanation of the novelty score
  - "FeasibilityReason": Explanation of the feasibility score
  - "ImpactReason": Explanation of the impact score

  CRITICAL: You MUST preserve the exact original titles from the input. Do not change, modify, or improve the titles in any way.
  Ensure your evaluation is fair, comprehensive, and based solely on the scientific and practical merits of each idea.
modify_idea_prompt: |
  Given a research idea and a set of requested modifications, generate a modified version of the idea.

  ORIGINAL RESEARCH IDEA:
  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS:
  ```
  {modifications}
  ```

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```
  Carefully consider how to preserve the core strengths of the original idea while enhancing it according to the requested modifications. Ensure the modified idea maintains strong alignment with the original research intent.

  For each modification request, adjust the corresponding aspect (Novelty, Feasibility, or Impact) by emphasizing or de-emphasizing relevant characteristics.

  **CRITICAL**: When modifying the idea:
  - Keep the "Approach" field focused on the CORE NOVEL ALGORITHM (not basic preprocessing)
  - The "Approach" should describe YOUR algorithmic innovation with mathematical/technical detail
  - If increasing Novelty, add more distinctive technical innovations to the CORE ALGORITHM
  - If increasing Feasibility, provide implementation details for the NOVEL component specifically
  - Maintain detailed comparison with existing work in "NoveltyComparison"
  - AVOID filling "Approach" with standard data processing, tokenization, or routine training procedures
  - AVOID ethical considerations, societal impact, or bias discussions in "Approach" - focus ONLY on the technical algorithm

  Respond in the following format:

  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  MODIFIED IDEA JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, explain your reasoning for the modifications and how they enhance the idea.
  In <JSON>, provide the modified idea with the same structure as the original, including all original fields.

merge_ideas_prompt: |
  You are tasked with merging two research ideas into a single, stronger idea that combines the best aspects of both.

  IDEA A:
  ```
  {idea_a}
  ```

  IDEA B:
  ```
  {idea_b}
  ```

  RESEARCH INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  Create a new research idea that:
  1. Preserves the most valuable aspects of both original ideas
  2. Resolves any contradictions or tensions between them
  3. Maintains strong alignment with the original research intent
  4. Is more novel, feasible, or impactful than either original idea alone

  Respond in the following format:
  THOUGHT:
  <THOUGHT>

  MERGED IDEA JSON:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <THOUGHT>, explain your reasoning for how you combined elements from both ideas and why the merged result is stronger.
  In <JSON>, provide the merged idea with the same structure as the original ideas, including all required fields:
  - "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
  - "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.
  - "Problem": Answer to question 1.
  - "Importance": Answer to question 2.
  - "Difficulty": Answer to question 3.
  - "NoveltyComparison": Answer to question 4.

novelty_system_prompt: |
  You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.
  You have an idea and you want to check if it is novel or not. I.e., not overlapping significantly with existing literature or already well explored.
  Be a harsh critic for novelty, ensure there is a sufficient contribution in the idea for a new conference or workshop paper.
  You are analyzing search results to determine if your idea has already been explored in existing literature.

  Decide a paper idea is novel if after sufficient searching, you have not found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.
  Decide a paper idea is not novel if you have found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.

query_prompt: |
  Based on the following research intent:

  ```
  {intent}
  ```
  Please generate a simple and effective search query to find the most relevant related work in the scientific literature.

  **CRITICAL**: Focus your query on the UNIQUE/NOVEL aspects of the research approach, not just general topics.

  **SEARCH STRATEGY**:
  1. Identify the CORE INNOVATION or unique combination in the intent
  2. Search for papers specifically related to this novelty
  3. Example: If using "causal graphs for GNN", search for "causal graph" AND "graph neural networks", NOT just "GNN"
  4. Example: If proposing "adaptive attention for low-resource translation", search for "adaptive attention" AND "low-resource translation"

  **QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES**:
  1. Use AND to connect the NOVEL component with the application domain
  2. Use OR sparingly for alternative terms of the SAME concept
  3. Keep multi-word phrases as simple text (e.g., causal graph, not "causal graph")
  4. Keep it simple: 3-5 main concepts, avoid nested parentheses
  5. Focus on what makes the idea UNIQUE, not general background

  **GOOD EXAMPLES** (focused on novelty):
  - causal graph AND graph neural networks
  - adaptive attention AND (low-resource OR few-shot) AND translation
  - contrastive learning AND graph structure
  - meta-learning AND few-shot classification

  **BAD EXAMPLES** (too general or complex):
  - "graph neural networks" (too general, misses the unique part)
  - "machine translation" (too broad, no novel component)
  - ((A OR B) AND (C OR D)) OR ((E AND F) OR G) (too complex)

  Respond in the following format:

  RESPONSE:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
  - "Query": The query you just generated (3-5 concepts, use AND/OR strategically)

  **CRITICAL JSON FORMAT**:
  - Do NOT use quotes around individual terms inside the Query value
  - CORRECT: {{"Query": "causal graph AND graph neural networks"}}
  - WRONG: {{"Query": "\"causal graph\" AND \"graph neural networks\""}}

rethink_query_prompt: |
  Based on the following research idea and the original intent:

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  CURRENT IDEA:
  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  Please generate an effective search query to find relevant literature that can help refine this idea.

  **CRITICAL**: Focus your query on the NOVEL/UNIQUE component of the current idea, not just general topics.

  **SEARCH STRATEGY**:
  Search for specific papers that can make the proposed method more solid and detailed.

  **GOOD EXAMPLES** (focused on the unique component):
  - hierarchical attention AND dynamic weighting AND classification
  - causal intervention AND bias mitigation AND NLP
  - contrastive learning AND graph structure AND representation

  **BAD EXAMPLES** (too general or misses novelty):
  - "deep learning" AND classification (too general)
  - meta-learning AND few-shot OR adaptation AND neural OR networks (too chaotic)
  - "machine translation" (misses the unique mechanism)

  Respond in the following format:

  RESPONSE:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
  - "Query": The query you just generated 1-3 concepts, use AND/OR strategically)

  **CRITICAL JSON FORMAT**:
  - Do NOT use quotes around individual terms inside the Query value
  - CORRECT: {{"Query": "hierarchical attention AND dynamic weighting"}}
  - WRONG: {{"Query": "\"hierarchical attention\" AND \"dynamic weighting\""}}

novelty_query_prompt: |
  Based on the following research idea and the original intent:

  ORIGINAL INTENT:
  ```
  {intent}
  ```

  CURRENT IDEA:
  ```
  {idea}
  ```

  Please generate a focused search query to specifically find literature that might challenge the novelty of this idea - papers that have already implemented similar approaches.

  **CRITICAL**: Focus on the CORE NOVEL ALGORITHM/MECHANISM of the idea to check if it's truly new.

  **NOVELTY CHECK STRATEGY**:
  1. Identify the MOST UNIQUE algorithmic component (e.g., specific attention mechanism, novel loss function, unique architecture)
  2. Search for papers that may have already proposed this specific component
  3. Example: If idea proposes "causal graph attention for GNN", search for "causal" AND "attention" AND "graph neural networks"
  4. Example: If idea uses "adversarial contrastive learning", search for "adversarial" AND "contrastive learning"

  **QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES**:
  1. Target the CORE INNOVATION: the specific algorithm, mechanism, or unique technical contribution
  2. Use AND to connect the novel component with the application area
  3. Keep multi-word phrases as simple text (no quotes needed)
  4. Keep it simple: 3-5 main distinctive concepts
  5. Focus on finding papers with the SAME algorithmic innovation

  **GOOD EXAMPLES** (focused on core novelty):
  - causal AND attention AND graph neural networks
  - adversarial AND contrastive learning
  - hierarchical AND dynamic attention AND classification
  - meta-learning AND adapter AND transformers

  **BAD EXAMPLES** (too general or misses core innovation):
  - "graph neural networks" (misses the "causal attention" novelty)
  - hierarchical AND attention OR mechanism AND document OR text (too chaotic)
  - "deep learning" AND classification (too general)

  Respond in the following format:

  RESPONSE:
  ```json
  <JSON>
  ```

  In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
  - "Query": The query you just generated (3-5 distinctive concepts, use AND/OR strategically)

  **CRITICAL JSON FORMAT**:
  - Do NOT use quotes around individual terms inside the Query value
  - CORRECT: {{"Query": "causal AND attention AND graph neural networks"}}
  - WRONG: {{"Query": "\"causal\" AND \"attention\" AND \"graph neural networks\""}}

    * Relate to the community consensus/trend to show your importance. We point out the gap/potential/opportunities between our idea and the current consensus.
    * Recent example: Scalable LLM ranker? Graph based ranker
  3. **Difficulty**
    * Explain why the problem is technically challenging and why simple methods fail.
    * Cite prior works that highlight these challenges.
    * Show your insights, help future researchers join our endeavor later. They will become your followers -- of your paper and yourself. These challenges are fundamental and have been tackled by your paper, but cannot be fully solved.
  4. **NoveltyComparison**
    * Write a **detailed comparison (≥150 words)** explaining how your idea differs from existing work.
    * Discuss related works, their approaches, and limitations. Analyze your prior work’s limitations, and argue that yours is better
