    "Approach": "Our core mechanism involves a dynamic context-awareness module that evaluates the complexity and structure of the code task at hand. (1) To address context window limitations, our method segments prompts into contextually informed units, preserving essential information across long sequences. (2) For the inflexibility of static methods, we introduce a feedback loop that continuously adapts prompt decomposition based on real-time complexity assessments. (3) In balancing decomposition granularity, our approach uses a computational model to predict the optimal segment size for maintaining coherence without overwhelming the model's synthesis capabilities. These innovations enable our method to dynamically adjust to diverse coding tasks, ensuring coherent long-range code generation.",
