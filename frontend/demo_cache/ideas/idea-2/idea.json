  "content": "**Description:**\nThis research explores whether adaptive prompt decomposition can significantly improve the coherence and accuracy of long-range code generation using large language models (LLMs).\n\n**Impact:**\nAs software projects grow in complexity, generating coherent and accurate code over long ranges becomes critical. Current LLMs often struggle with maintaining coherence and context over extended sequences, leading to errors and inefficiencies. Addressing this gap can significantly improve automated coding tools, enhancing productivity for developers. Recent literature, such as 'Scaling Transformer Models for Long-Range Sequence Tasks' and the demand for 'Automated End-to-End Software Development', highlight the growing need for solutions in this space.\n\n**Feasibility:**\n(1) Maintaining context over long sequences is inherently challenging due to the limited memory and attention span of current models, often leading to context drift. (2) Existing models are typically trained on static prompts, lacking adaptability to complex and evolving code structures. (3) Simple decomposition techniques can fragment the sequence, disrupting the logical flow and reducing overall coherence in generated code.\n\n**Novelty:**\nPrevious works in code generation have primarily focused on improving model architecture or increasing model size to handle long-range tasks. However, these approaches often lead to increased computational costs and only marginal improvements in coherence. Static prompt techniques, such as fixed-size windowing, fail to adapt dynamically to varying code structures and contexts. Our approach introduces adaptive prompt decomposition, which tailors prompt segmentation based on the code's structural and contextual needs.

    "Approach": "Our approach employs a dynamic algorithm that analyzes the structure of the code and the model's attention patterns to adaptively segment prompts. (1) To maintain context over long sequences, we develop a context-aware segmentation that adjusts the prompt length based on contextual requirements, ensuring that the model retains relevant information across boundaries. (2) For adaptability in complex structures, we introduce a feedback loop where the model assesses coherence after each segment generation, dynamically adjusting the subsequent prompt structure. (3) To address fragmentation, our method uses semantic analysis to ensure logical continuity across decomposed prompts, preserving the flow of code.",
