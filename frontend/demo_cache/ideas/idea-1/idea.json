  "content": "**Description:**\nThis research explores the development of an adaptive prompt decomposition method to enhance the coherence of long-range code generation by large language models (LLMs).\n\n**Impact:**\nThe ability for LLMs to generate coherent, long-range code is increasingly vital as software systems grow in complexity and require extensive code automation. Current methods often struggle with maintaining coherence over long sequences, leading to fragmented or inconsistent outputs. Recent works like Codex and CodeBERT have shown potential but do not fully address long-range coherence. This gap highlights the need for research in adaptive techniques that can decompose prompts intelligently to maintain coherence across larger codebases, aligning with the trend towards more autonomous coding tools.\n\n**Feasibility:**\n(1) Coherence over long sequences is challenging due to the limitations in the context window size of LLMs, which causes information loss. (2) Existing prompt engineering techniques are often static, lacking the adaptability needed to manage diverse and dynamic code structures. (3) Ensuring that adaptive decomposition does not introduce overhead or complexity that outweighs its benefits is non-trivial. (4) Balancing the granularity of decomposition with the model's ability to synthesize meaningful code segments is difficult.\n\n**Novelty:**\nWhile recent works like OpenAI's Codex and Google's PaLM have made strides in code generation, they largely focus on enhancing the model's overall capacity to understand and generate code rather than addressing how prompts can be decomposed adaptively for better coherence. Static approaches in prompt engineering fail to account for the dynamic nature of real-world coding tasks, often leading to suboptimal performance when generating large blocks of code. Our approach introduces a novel adaptive mechanism that evaluates the structure and complexity of a given task, dynamically adjusting prompt decomposition to maintain coherence over extensive sequences. This method surpasses existing limitations by integrating context-awareness into the decomposition process, a capability not fully realized in current models.",

    "Approach": "The core of our approach involves an algorithm that dynamically analyzes the input prompt's structure and complexity, using this analysis to segment the prompt into smaller, more manageable components. These components are then processed in a manner that preserves their interdependencies, ensuring coherence across the entire generated code. (1) By employing a context-aware segmentation strategy, our method mitigates context window limitations, allowing for more coherent long-range outputs. (2) The adaptability of our method comes from a feedback loop where the model continuously evaluates the output's coherence and adjusts decomposition granularity as needed. (3) To prevent additional overhead, the algorithm prioritizes efficiency by limiting decomposition to critical sections that influence overall coherence. Our approach not only addresses the identified difficulties but also enhances the feasibility of using LLMs for generating comprehensive, coherent code.",
