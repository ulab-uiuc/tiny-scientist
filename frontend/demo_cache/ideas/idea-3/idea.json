As LLMs become more capable, the expectation for them to handle more complex and lengthy coding tasks increases. However, maintaining coherence over long spans is challenging due to the limitations of current models in managing context effectively. Addressing this problem is vital to advance AI's practical applications in software engineering, particularly in scenarios requiring extended codebases or scripts, such as automated testing or code refactoring.

(2) Existing methods struggle with balancing between retaining necessary context and reducing computational load, often leading to loss of relevant information or excessive computation. (3) Adaptive techniques require sophisticated model tuning to dynamically adjust prompting strategies based on the task and input, which is both computationally intensive and complex to implement reliably.\n\n**Novelty:**\nWhile previous research on large language models, such as OpenAI's Codex, has explored code generation capabilities, these models often fall short when tasked with generating coherent long-range code. Existing methods typically rely on static prompt strategies that do not adapt to the context or complexity of the task, leading to a drop in coherence and relevance as the length of the generated code increases. In contrast, our approach, adaptive prompt decomposition, introduces a dynamic mechanism that adjusts the prompt strategy based on ongoing context analysis. This method leverages recent advances in reinforcement learning and context window optimization to maintain coherence without overwhelming computation requirements. Unlike traditional methods that treat prompt decomposition as a fixed pre-processing step, our adaptive model iteratively updates its strategy, allowing for more fine-tuned and context-aware prompt modifications. This adaptability is key to solving the previously unmet challenge of maintaining coherence in long-range code generation.",

    "Approach": "The core algorithm of our proposed method involves dynamically adjusting prompt decomposition strategies using a reinforcement learning framework. This system evaluates the coherence and relevance of generated code segments in real-time, and modifies the decomposition strategy based on feedback from these evaluations. To tackle (1), our method uses a context-aware feedback loop that assesses coherence metrics and modifies prompt strategies dynamically. For (2), we incorporate optimization techniques that prioritize context retention while minimizing computational overhead by leveraging model parallelism and efficient data structures. Lastly, to address (3), we employ advanced tuning methods that adjust model parameters based on task complexity and input characteristics, ensuring that the adaptive mechanism remains robust and reliable across various code generation scenarios.",
