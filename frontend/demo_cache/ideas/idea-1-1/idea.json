    "Approach": "Our core algorithm involves a dynamic prompt decomposition mechanism that evaluates the task's structural and contextual complexity. (1) To address context window limitations, we introduce a sliding window mechanism that adapts the context window size based on real-time task analysis. (2) For handling dynamic task nature, we propose a feedback loop where the model evaluates intermediate outputs to adjust decomposition strategies. (3) To balance granularity and synthesis, the algorithm uses a hierarchical approach, breaking down tasks into nested segments that maintain logical coherence. (4) To manage computational overhead, we incorporate a lightweight heuristic-driven evaluation that determines when and how to adjust decomposition strategies, ensuring efficiency.",
