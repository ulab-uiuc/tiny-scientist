    "Approach": "The core algorithm involves a dynamic prompt decomposition strategy that evaluates the task's complexity and context. (1) To tackle coherence issues, our method uses a sliding window technique combined with semantic analysis to ensure that context is maintained throughout generation. (2) We introduce an adaptive mechanism that analyzes code structure and adjusts decomposition dynamically, unlike static methods that fail in diverse environments. (3) Our method balances granularity by using a feedback loop that assesses the coherence of generated segments, ensuring that the synthesis capability remains intact while preventing information loss.",
