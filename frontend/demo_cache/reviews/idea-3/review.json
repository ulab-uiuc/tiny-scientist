  "Summary": "The paper explores adaptive prompt decomposition strategies to improve the coherence of long-range code generation using large language models. It employs reinforcement learning to refine prompt strategies dynamically. However, experimental results show no improvement in coherence, with BLEU and ROUGE-L scores remaining at zero across all runs.",
  "Strengths": [
    "The paper addresses a relevant problem in the field of AI-assisted coding.",
    "It attempts to integrate reinforcement learning for dynamic prompt adaptation."
  ],
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The methodology did not result in any measurable improvement in code coherence.",
    "The experimental results consistently show zero scores, questioning the validity of the approach.",
    "The paper lacks a convincing demonstration of the novelty or practical significance of the contributions.",
    "The evaluation metrics used may not be suitable for capturing the intended improvements."
