    "Summary": "The paper introduces an adaptive prompt decomposition framework leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance long-range code generation coherence in large language models. The approach dynamically adjusts prompt strategies based on context feedback, claiming improved semantic coherence with high ROUGE scores.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Low BLEU scores raise questions about genuine coherence improvements.",
      "Limited empirical validation with a simple model and dataset.",
      "Potential scalability issues for more complex coding tasks.",
      "Lack of exploration of societal impacts of AI-generated code."
