    "Decision": "Reject",
    "Ethical Concerns": true,
    "Limitations": [
      "Limited generalizability due to the use of a single non-code dataset.",
      "Potential challenges in applying the method across different coding tasks and datasets are not explored."

    "Questions": [
      "Why was the AG News dataset chosen for evaluating code generation tasks?",
      "Can the authors provide more details on how the adaptive feedback loop is implemented and evaluated?",
      "How is computational overhead measured and compared to baseline methods?"
    ],
    "Significance": 2,
    "Soundness": 2,
    "Strengths": [
      "Addresses a relevant challenge in maintaining coherence in long-range code generation.",
      "Proposes an adaptive mechanism that iteratively refines prompt decomposition."
    ],
    "Summary": "The paper introduces Adaptive Prompt Decomposition for enhancing long-range coherence in code generation with LLMs. It dynamically segments input prompts based on structural complexity and employs an adaptive feedback loop to refine the decomposition process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inappropriate choice of dataset (AG News) for evaluating code generation coherence.",
      "Lack of detailed implementation and evaluation of the adaptive feedback loop.",
      "Insufficient discussion on limitations and potential societal impacts.",
      "Claims of reduced computational overhead are not empirically supported.",
      "Ethical concerns regarding the deployment of LLMs in critical code generation tasks are not addressed."
