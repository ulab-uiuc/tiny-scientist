    "Ethical Concerns": false,
    "Limitations": [
      "Potential misalignment with appropriate benchmarks for code generation.",
      "Risk of the approach being less novel than claimed.",

    "Questions": [
      "Why was the AG News dataset chosen for evaluating code generation tasks?",
      "How does the method compare with more domain-specific datasets or tasks?",
      "Can the authors provide further justification for the use of BLEU and ROUGE-L scores?"
    ],
    "Significance": 2,
    "Soundness": 2,
    "Strengths": [
      "Addresses a significant challenge in long-range code generation with LLMs.",
      "Proposes a novel adaptive prompt decomposition technique.",
      "Claims computational efficiency compared to scaling model sizes."
    ],
    "Summary": "The paper introduces an adaptive prompt decomposition method to enhance coherence and accuracy in long-range code generation. The approach involves dynamic prompt segmentation based on code structure and context, a feedback loop for coherence evaluation, and semantic analysis for logical continuity. Experiments demonstrate improved BLEU and ROUGE-L scores.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The novelty of the approach is questionable given similar methods in literature.",
      "Choice of AG News dataset for code generation is unconventional and potentially unsuitable.",
      "Evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L may not fully capture coherence improvements.",
      "Lack of detailed comparison with more relevant datasets or tasks for code generation."
