{
  "Summary": "The paper introduces an adaptive prompt decomposition technique aimed at improving code generation with large language models. It utilizes a single-layer GRU model to maintain context and coherence over long code sequences. The technique achieves impressive metrics on AST Parse Rate and Undefined Reference Count in the HumanEval dataset, but it underperforms in functional correctness as demonstrated by low pass@1 scores.",
  "Strengths": [
    "Innovative approach to prompt decomposition in code generation.",
    "Resource-efficient method using a single-layer GRU model."
  ],
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Poor functional correctness with a pass@1 score of 0.0.",
    "Lacks clarity in illustrating significant advantages over existing models.",
    "Inadequate discussion on potential negative societal impacts and ethical issues.",
    "Limited contribution and practical significance due to low performance."
