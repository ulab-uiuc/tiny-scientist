Experiment Description:
In this experiment, we used a SimpleGRUClassifier with a GRU layer and a linear layer to classify IMDB reviews. The model was trained using subsampled training data from the IMDB dataset, with a validation set for hyperparameter tuning and a separate test set for evaluating the model's generalization.
