  Abstract: |
    - TL;DR of the paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)

    Please make sure the abstract reads smoothly and is well-motivated. This should be one continuous paragraph with no breaks between the lines.

  Introduction: |
    - Longer version of the Abstract, i.e. of the entire paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
    - New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points
    - Extra space? Future work!

  Related Work: |
    - Focus on academic siblings of our work — i.e., alternative approaches in the literature attempting to solve the same or similar problem.
    - The goal is to "compare and contrast": how do these methods differ in assumptions, objectives, or techniques?
    - Simply describing a paper is not enough — explain how it relates to our study and why it matters.
    - If a cited method is applicable to our problem setting, note its strengths or weaknesses. If it is not applicable, clearly justify why.
    - Organize the discussion into coherent subtopics or themes.
    - Use only the provided paper list, and cite each using \cite{{...}} placeholders.

  Method: |
    - What we do. Why we do it. All described using the general Formalism introduced in the Problem Setting and building on top of the concepts / foundations introduced in Background.

  Experimental Setup: |
    - How do we test that our stuff works? Introduces a specific instantiation of the Problem Setting and specific implementation details of our Method for this Problem Setting.
    - Do not imagine unknown hardware details.
    - Includes a description of the dataset, evaluation metrics, important hyperparameters, and implementation details.

  Results: |
    - Shows the results of running Method on our problem described in Experimental Setup.
    - Includes statements on hyperparameters and other potential issues of fairness.
    - Only includes results that have actually been run and saved in the logs. Do not hallucinate results that don't exist.
    - If results exist: compares to baselines and includes statistics and confidence intervals.
    - If results exist: includes ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
    - Discusses limitations of the method.
    - Make sure to include all the results from the experiments, and include all relevant figures.

  Discussion: |
    - Analyze what the experimental results reveal in the context of the original research question.
    - Reflect on whether your method outperformed the baseline — and why that might be the case.
    - Discuss any cases where your method underperformed or behaved unexpectedly.
    - Identify the strengths and weaknesses of your approach based on the comparison to the baseline.
    - Connect these insights to the broader literature or practical use cases (without repeating the Related Work section).
    - Acknowledge limitations in the findings and suggest possible improvements.
    - Offer realistic ideas for future work or applications of your method.


  Conclusion: |
    - Brief recap of the entire paper.
    - To keep going with the analogy, you can think of future work as (potential) academic offspring.
