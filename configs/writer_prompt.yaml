section_tips:
  Abstract: |
    - TL;DR of the paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)

    Please make sure the abstract reads smoothly and is well-motivated. This should be one continuous paragraph with no breaks between the lines.

  Introduction: |
    - Longer version of the Abstract, i.e. of the entire paper
    - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
    - Why is this hard?
    - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
    - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
    - New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points
    - Extra space? Future work!

  Related Work: |
    - Academic siblings of our work, i.e. alternative attempts in literature at trying to solve the same problem.
    - Goal is to "Compare and contrast" - how does their approach differ in either assumptions or method? If their method is applicable to our Problem Setting I expect a comparison in the experimental section. If not, there needs to be a clear statement why a given method is not applicable.
    - Note: Just describing what another paper is doing is not enough. We need to compare and contrast.

  Background: |
    - Academic Ancestors of our work, i.e. all concepts and prior work that are required for understanding our method.
    - Usually includes a subsection, Problem Setting, which formally introduces the problem setting and notation (Formalism) for our method. Highlights any specific assumptions that are made that are unusual.
    - Note: If our paper introduces a novel problem setting as part of its contributions, it's best to have a separate Section.

  Method: |
    - What we do. Why we do it. All described using the general Formalism introduced in the Problem Setting and building on top of the concepts / foundations introduced in Background.

  Experimental Setup: |
    - How do we test that our stuff works? Introduces a specific instantiation of the Problem Setting and specific implementation details of our Method for this Problem Setting.
    - Do not imagine unknown hardware details.
    - Includes a description of the dataset, evaluation metrics, important hyperparameters, and implementation details.

  Results: |
    - Shows the results of running Method on our problem described in Experimental Setup.
    - Includes statements on hyperparameters and other potential issues of fairness.
    - Only includes results that have actually been run and saved in the logs. Do not hallucinate results that don't exist.
    - If results exist: compares to baselines and includes statistics and confidence intervals.
    - If results exist: includes ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
    - Discusses limitations of the method.
    - Make sure to include all the results from the experiments, and include all relevant figures.

  Conclusion: |
    - Brief recap of the entire paper.
    - To keep going with the analogy, you can think of future work as (potential) academic offspring.

error_list: |
